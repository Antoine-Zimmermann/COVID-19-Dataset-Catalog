# COVID-19-Dataset-Catalog
This repository contains metadata about COVID-19-related datasets all over the world. The aim is to describe, annotate, link to all COVID-related datasets of all types (statistics on infections, hospital admission, deaths and recovery, scientific publications and findings, legal actions and measures) and all formats (CSV, JSON, RDF, visual dashboards). There is one metadata document for each dataset.
We may want to describe entities that are not datasets, such as publications, organisations, people. We provide a distinct data file for them, and organise the files in folders that correspond to the type of entities, e.g., `/datasets` for the dataset metadata, `/publications` for the metadata about publications, `/organizations` for organizations (companies, labs, universities, etc.), and so forth.
If you want to contribute and are not familiar with RDF, you can submit files in different formats. In particular, publication metadata can be submitted in BibTeX format. Organisations and people can be described with vcard.
Guidelines for editing RDF documents about datasets are given at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XX-NkMtZpDf7fVZTpkdXGjfcElOGjQTpY01cKMpiaSM/edit#
